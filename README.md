# Plan Your Day

A quick and easy to use tool to plan your day more efficiently

## Motivation

Here I have created a daily planner to organize the events of my day. It will indicate what hour an event will take place and allow me to edit the content of individual hours as I deem necessary. Past, present and future events will be indicated by different colors, furthering the application's organization of my 9 to 5 work day. I will be able to save each event to its chosen time slot, making my schedule accessible even after refreshing the application. Organization is key, and now I have a tool to assist me in staying on task, being prepared for upcoming events, and keeping track of what I have already accomplished for the day. Happy Coding!
